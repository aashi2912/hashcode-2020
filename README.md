# Google Hash Code Problem 2020 

OverEngineers  Team solution for [Google Hashcode 2020](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode).


## Qualification Problem

Given a description of libraries and books available, plan which books to scan from which library to maximize the total score of all scanned books, taking into account that each library needs to be signed up before it can ship books.

```bash
A - 21
B - 5,822,900
C - 5,471,407
D - 4,815,395
E - 731,299
F - 1,832,294

Total Score: 18,673,316
```

## Compiling

##### Intellij IDEA

```bash
File -> Project Structure -> Artifacts
```
In there, you can then create a new artifact by clicking the + icon. This will give you an option for the file type, which is .JAR and which modules you want to include in your artifact. When you're done, you go to..
```bash
Build -> Build Artifacts
```
And it will create the JAR file from your project.

##### Eclipse

```bash
Right click on Project -> Export -> JAR File -> Select the Java files to include
```
When you've done this, hit finish and you're golden. The tutorial also adds some additional tips in to make it as seamless as possible.


## Running

```bash
$ java -jar
